# Verifiable Credential Repository

This repository contains a registry created by the
LACChain ID Working Group for the purpose of maintaining a list of [Credential Schemes](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#contexts) (in JSON-LD format)
for different credential types. Also, an example of the credential associated with each schema will be kept in this repository.

## Contributing to the Repository

Use the standard fork, branch, and pull request workflow to propose new credential type.

1. Add your VC Scheme to /schemes folder
2. Add your VC Example to /examples folder
3. Edit credentials.md file to include your credential type information

Contributions to this repository are intended to become part of LACChain ID Whitepaper. To make substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate
in the relevant LACChain ID Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.

If you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all
contributors in the pull request comment.

To add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:

```
+@github_username
```

If you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:

```
-@github_username
```

If you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the
feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.
